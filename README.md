# Welcome to my first responsive, mobile first and pure vanilla css site 

### Charlotte Aneriksson presents
A fictitious art gallery by a made-up artist named Hillary Audine.
She, the made-up artist wishes to reach out to people in grief, people in hopelessness seeking hope.
She has just come out of deep and dark griefing process after loosing her husband and now she wished to help others.

### Good to now
This is only a fictious site where responsiveness is in focus. Also in focus in the creation proccess is the mobile first approach.
